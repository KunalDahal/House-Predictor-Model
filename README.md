# House Price Prediction Fun Project

Hey there! This is a chill little machine learning project where I messed around with linear regression to predict house prices. It's not gonna win any awards, but it was fun to tinker with!

## What's Inside?

- `main.ipynb`: The main notebook where the magic (or not-so-magic) happens with the model.
- `cleaner.ipynb`: For scrubbing the data and making it look presentable and train the model well.
- `dataset/`: Got the raw and cleaned house price data in here.

Feel free to poke around, run the notebooks, and see what happens. If it breaks, well, that's part of the fun! 😄

Getting 92% accuracy dem!
